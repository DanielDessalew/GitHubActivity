Driving in the desolate streets of Queens at 5:00 in the morning, Mary lets out a big
yawn as she turns the radio up. She stayed up late reading her new sci-fi book, 
despite knowing she'd have to wake up early. Approaching the intersection on 42nd, 
she stared at the green traffic light and softly mumbled: "stay green, stay green", but
per usual the light turned right as she got closer. Stopped at the red light she lets out
a deep "ugh". Suddenly, her car starts shaking so does the traffic light and everything around her.
A load roar let out and blinding light in front of her car come at of nowhere.

Suddenly there was electricity flashing and popping in her eyes and she couldn't see anything...
After a while, Mary opened her eyes and found herself in her car still, driving near the 42's 
intersection. She immediately checked the clock and it read... "4:59"! "I went back in time!" 
Mary exclaimed. However, she did not forget about the traffic light. "Stay green, stay green..."
She mumbled. And just as she was coming close to the intersection, the light turned red...
