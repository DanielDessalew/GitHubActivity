Driving in the desolate streets of Queens at 5:00 in the morning, Mary lets out a big
yawn as she turns the radio up. She stayed up late reading her new sci-fi book, 
despite knowing she'd have to wake up early. Approaching the intersection on 42nd, 
she stared at the green traffic light and softly mumbled: "stay green, stay green", but
per usual the light turned right as she got closer. Stopped at the red light she lets out
a deep "ugh". Suddenly, her car starts shaking so does the traffic light and everything around her.
A load roar let out and blinding light in front of her car come at of nowhere.
